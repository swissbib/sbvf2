<ul class="list">

  
        <li><strong><i>Circulation state</i> is always empty.</strong>
            <br>Some functions need JavaScript, which seems to be disabled on your computer.
        </li>

        <li><strong><i>URL: Onlinezugriff</i> doesn't link to the full text.</strong>
            <br>The link only works if you are logged in to the network of a university that has a licence for this title.

    <li><strong>What is Sorting by relevancy?</strong>
        <br><i>Books &amp; more:</i><br>Hits in title fields, especially journal titles, rank higher than hits in author
        names or themes. New publications sort before older ones. These settings are tuned by us.<br>
        <i>Articles &amp; more:</i><br>Hits in author names rank highly, some of the full texts are indexed. Here we can't
        influence the order as it is part of the data we get from Summon Local.
    </li>
   
     <li><strong>Why are there titles with the facet <i>Article</i> in <i>Books &amp; more</i>?</strong>
         <br><i>Books &amp; more</i> and <i>Articles &amp; more</i> are two seperate catalogs, see <i><a href="about.phtml">About swissbib</a></i>
     </li>

    <li><strong>Why does it take so many clicks to get to the <i>Informations about holdings</i>?</strong>
        <br>Shortcut: hold the mouse over the <img
                src="<***?= $this->basePath('themes/swissbib/css/themes/orange/img/icon_info.gif') ?>"> in the result list,
        then click on the name of the library you are interested in.
