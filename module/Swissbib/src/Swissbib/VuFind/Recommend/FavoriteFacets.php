 * FavoriteFacets Recommendations Module

 * This class provides special facets for the Favorites area (tags/lists)
 * The VuFind class was extended because we need the former functionality where lists are only
 * shown in case the menu item favorite lists is chosen by users
 * Newer version of VF2 (2.2.1) seems to display favorite lists on every "My Research" page
 * we have to evaluate this later (project swissbib responsive design)
