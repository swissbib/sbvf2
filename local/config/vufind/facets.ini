; This section is used to identify facets for special treatment by the SideFacets
; recommendations module.
[SpecialFacets]
; Any fields listed below will be treated as date ranges rather than plain facets:
dateRange[] = publishDate

; This section is reserved for special boolean facets.  These are displayed
; as checkboxes.  If the box is checked, the filter on the left side of the
; equal sign is applied.  If the box is not checked, the filter is not applied.
; The value on the right side of the equal sign is the text to display to the
; user.  It will be run through the translation code, so be sure to update the
; language files appropriately.
;
; Leave the section empty if you do not need checkbox facets.
;
; NOTE: Do not create CheckboxFacets using values that also exist in the
;       other facet sections above -- this will not work correctly.
